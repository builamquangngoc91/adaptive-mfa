# Adaptive MFA Login

## Introduction

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a widely adopted security mechanism for protecting web applications and user identities. It adds an additional layer of verification to prevent unauthorized accessâ€”even in cases where attackers have obtained valid credentials. However, traditional MFA can introduce unnecessary friction for legitimate users.

This repository provides a self-contained implementation of an **Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** system, which intelligently assesses login risk and dynamically determines whether additional verification is necessary.

By analyzing contextual signals such as:

- IP address  
- Device fingerprint  
- User-agent  

the system evaluates the risk level associated with each login attempt.

Based on this assessment, users may be prompted for secondary authentication via configurable methods, including:

- **OTP via Email or SMS**
- **TOTP** using authenticator apps such as **Google Authenticator** or **Authy**

The goal is to maintain a strong security posture while minimizing disruption to trusted users.

### System Modules

- **Adaptive MFA System**  
  Acts as the entry point for user requests and coordinates the login flow.

- **Authentication Module**  
  Validates user credentials and interfaces with the Risk Assessment Module to determine whether MFA is required.

- **Risk Assessment Module**  
  Calculates a risk score based on contextual data and determines the need for MFA enforcement.

- **MFA Module**  
  Handles the generation, delivery, and verification of MFA codes (via email, SMS, or TOTP).

- **Database**  
  Stores user profiles, login history, and MFA configuration data.
